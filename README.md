TODO:
* audio: fix in both
* delete unused media files 
* delete zip file in anki
* test audio upload: what if I upload too many audio files? what if I uploaded less than expected?

later:
* upload tags + language
* font change on runtime
* sort/groupBy favorite and story
* more fields for stories? (like anki?)

Bugs:
* upload -> index auto load not working
