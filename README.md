TODO:
* delete unused media files while uploading
* delete zip file in anki
* process CSV and TXT differently: upload text + audio and specify how the audio should be dealt with (eg load audio alphabetically or by sorting)
* fix delete: delete audio directory 

later:
* upload tags + language
* font change on runtime
* sort/groupBy favorite and story
* more fields for stories? (like anki?)

Bugs:
* upload -> index auto load not working
