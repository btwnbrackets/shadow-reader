TODO:
* process CSV and TXT differently: upload text + audio and specify how the audio should be dealt with (eg load audio alphabetically or by sorting)

later:
* upload tags + language
* index grid view + list view
* sub folders? sub-decks? anki tags?
* font change on runtime
* sort/groupBy favorite and story
* more fields for stories? (like anki?)
* audio speed up or slow down
* history stopped at
